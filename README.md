ü©∫ Disease Predictor - A Machine Learning Web App
This is a web application that predicts the likelihood of having Diabetes or Anemia based on user-input health data. The project uses machine learning models to make predictions and a Flask-based backend to serve the user interface.

‚ú® Features
Dual Disease Prediction: Predicts the probability of two different health conditions:

Diabetes

Anemia

User-Friendly Web Interface: Simple and intuitive HTML forms for data input.

Real-Time Predictions: Instantly get a prediction after submitting the required health parameters.

Powered by Scikit-learn: Utilizes robust machine learning models trained for classification tasks.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Libraries Used
The project is built using the following technologies:

Backend: Python, Flask

Frontend: HTML, CSS

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy

Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook

ü§ñ Machine Learning Models
This application uses two distinct machine learning models for its predictions:

Diabetes Prediction: A Support Vector Machine (SVM) model (svm_model.pkl) is used to classify whether a person has diabetes based on metrics like glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, etc.

Anemia Prediction: A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model (knn_model.pkl) is used to determine the likelihood of anemia based on blood sample data such as Gender, Hemoglobin, MCH, MCV, and MCHC.

The complete model training and data exploration process can be found in the Multiple_Disease_Prediction.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.
